## Windows 10

* Install WSL2 (Windows subsystem for Linux) refer to this [official guide.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10) WSL2 requires Windows 10, version 2004 or higher. Note: You may not have to install a Linux distribution unless needed.

* Download and install Docker [Desktop for Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe). Double-click `Docker for Windows Installer` to run the installer. More instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Official guide for docker WSL2 backend can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/). Note: Check that you are specifically using WSL2 backend for Docker.

* Download and install [Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.21.0.windows.1/Git-2.21.0-64-bit.exe). When installing the package please keep all options by default. More information about the package can be found [here](https://gitforwindows.org).

* Download and install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). It is the only browser which is supported by CVAT.

* Go to windows menu, find `Git Bash` application and run it. You should see a terminal window.

* Clone CVAT source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/cvat).

  The following command will clone the latest develop branch:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/opencv/cvat
  cd cvat
  ```

  See [alternatives](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/installation/#how-to-get-cvat-source-code) if you want to download one of the release versions.

* Run docker containers. It will take some time to download the latest CVAT release and other required images like postgres, redis, etc. from DockerHub and create containers.

  `docker-compose up -d`

* (Optional) Use CVAT_VERSION environment variable to specify the version of CVAT you want to install specific version (e.g v2.1.0, dev). Default behavior: dev images will be pulled for develop branch, and corresponding release images for release versions.

  `CVAT_VERSION=dev docker-compose up -d`

* Alternative: if you want to build the images locally with unreleased changes see [How to pull/build/update CVAT images section](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/administration/basics/installation/#how-to-pullbuildupdate-cvat-images)

* You can register a user but by default it will not have rights even to view list of tasks. Thus you should create a superuser. A superuser can use an admin panel to assign correct groups to other users. Please use the command below:

  `winpty docker exec -it cvat_server bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'`

  If you donâ€™t have winpty installed or the above command does not work, you may also try the following:

  ```
  # enter docker image first
  docker exec -it cvat_server /bin/bash
  # then run
  python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

  Choose a username and a password for your admin account. For more information please read [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser).

* Open the installed Google Chrome browser and go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080). Type your login/password for the superuser on the login page and press the Login button. Now you should be able to create a new annotation task. Please read the [CVAT manual](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/) for more details.
